    "1. Use a `for` loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 20.\n",
    "2. If the number is divisible by 3, print \"Fizz\" instead of the number.\n",

    "4. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz\".\n",

    "6. Use a `break` statement to exit the loop if you encounter the number 18.\n",
