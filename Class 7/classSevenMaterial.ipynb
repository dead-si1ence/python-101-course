    "## 1. Understanding File Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start working with files, it's important to understand file paths. A file path is a string that represents the location of a file on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of file paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Absolute paths**: These start from the root directory of the file system. For example:\n",
    "   - Windows: `C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\file.txt`\n",
    "   - macOS/Linux: `/home/YourName/Documents/file.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relative paths**: These are relative to the current working directory. For example:\n",
    "   - `file.txt` (in the current directory)\n",
    "   - `data/file.txt` (in a subdirectory named 'data')\n",
    "   - `../file.txt` (in the parent directory)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use both forward slashes (/) and backslashes (\\\\) for file paths, even on Windows. However, if you use backslashes, you need to escape them or use a raw string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "path1 = 'C:\\\\Users\\\\YourName\\\\Documents\\\\file.txt'  # Escaped backslashes\n",
    "path2 = r'C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\file.txt'  # Raw string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For cross-platform compatibility, it's often best to use forward slashes or use the `os.path` module to handle paths."

    "## 2. Opening and Closing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use the `open()` function to open files. This function returns a file object, which we can then use to read from or write to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for opening a file is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `filename` is a string containing the name of the file (or the full path to the file)\n",
    "- `mode` is a string specifying how the file should be opened (we'll cover this in detail in the next section)\n",
    "\n",
    "After we're done working with a file, it's crucial to close it using the `close()` method. This frees up system resources and ensures that all data is properly saved.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. `'w'` (Write): \n",
    "   - Opens the file for writing.\n",
    "   - Creates a new file if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "   - If the file exists, it truncates the file (erases all content).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `'a'` (Append): \n",
    "   - Opens the file for appending.\n",
    "   - Creates a new file if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "   - If the file exists, the file pointer is placed at the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `'r+'` (Read and Write): \n",
    "   - Opens the file for both reading and writing.\n",
